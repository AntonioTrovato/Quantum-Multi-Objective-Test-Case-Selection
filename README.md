# Quantum-Regression-Test-Case-Selection
Regression testing is an important part of the software development process in software engineering. It is a practice aimed at identifying any regressions, which are the emergence of new defects or issues in a software application following changes, enhancements, or updates made to the source code. In other words, regression testing focuses on how changes made to the software can affect the correct behavior of existing features. Regression testing is particularly important in agile software development environments, where changes are made frequently and rapidly. This practice helps ensure that the software remains stable and reliable as it evolves over time. To conduct regression testing, it is necessary to identify a set of test cases that cover the existing functionalities of the software; this problem is known as the “Test Case Selection” problem. The problem of test case selection is a critical component of the regression testing process in the field of software engineering. This problem arises when choosing the test cases to be executed during a regression testing session, particularly when making changes to existing software. The project presented in this notebook is aimed at solving the test case selection problem for regression testing using a quantum algorithm (which will be explained later). This problem will be treated as a binary variable optimization problem to obtain a subset of the original test suite of a program under observation, with the objectives of minimizing the test execution cost and maximizing the probability of detecting errors and test code coverage.
